# Steam Roller

An all in one setup script for getting some of my favourite tools and accesories into the steam deck. You can use the interactive menu or pass the tools you want as parameters!

## Feautres:

 - Install Decky loader, Lutris, Heroic Launcher, EmuDeck, CryoUtilities, SGDBoop all by selecting then from the menu. No more jumping between webpages, desktop launcher icons and other online links!
 - Store your switch emulation keys and backup your copy of the script to a USB drive or cloud so you never lose your key dumps!

## Usage:

To download the script simply get the .sh file from this page. For those who aren't technically inclined this is a script file you run in an app on the steam deck called Konsole. Leave the script in your downloads folder, open Konsole from the steam decks desktop launch menu and run the following:

    chmod +x ./steam-roller.sh

This gives the script execution permissions on your steam deck. Then to run type:

    ./steam-roller.sh

This will bring you to the menu screen where you can type the function you want. For example for the about screen you'd type "About". For the more technically inclined you may use this by passing in command arguements. For example:

    ./steam-roller.sh Decky
